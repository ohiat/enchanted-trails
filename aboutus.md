Welcome to Enchanted Trails Adventures! ETA is the brainchild of Ben Shulman, a long time field guide and naturalist. I have worked as a field guide and naturalist for National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions from pole to pole: Antarctica, the Arctic, Alaska, Norway, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia Island. Though I love all aspects of Northern New Mexico's natural and human history, I specialize in birding, botany, ecology, and geology. I believe that natural history interpretation should be based in sound science and reveal the fascinating natural world we live in. I am also an accomplished nature & wildlife photographer, so bring your camera and your photography questions!

I moved to Santa Fe in 2022 and immediately fell in love with Northern New Mexico's natural beauty and natural history. I knew I had to start a guiding company to share Santa Fe's natural beauty with visitors, and thus Enchanted Trails Adventures was born.

Santa Fe is known for its culture, history, and art; however, it's natural beauty and history is the hidden treasure for visitors. I seek to bring that beauty and history to life by leading you on fascinating hikes and tours. Join me for a few hours and learn about the secrets of Northern New Mexico's nature!
