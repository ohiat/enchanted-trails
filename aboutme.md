Hi there! I'm Ben Shulman, your guide to the wonders of Santa Fe's natural landscape and the force behind Santa Fe Nature Guiding. I have worked for many years as a naturalist and field guide from Antarctica to the Arctic leading guests into wild places and teaching them about natural history. After many years of traveling the world as a guide, I am thrilled to be focusing on bringing people out into the nature of New Mexico.

Specializing in birding, botany, ecology, and geology, I bring a wealth of knowledge to our excursions. Having worked as a naturalist for National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions, I believe in the power of natural history interpretation grounded in sound science. I am also an accomplished nature and wildlife photographerâ€”so bring your camera if you like and any photography questions you may have!

Santa Fe Nature Guiding, is a platform through which I can share my enthusiasm for natural history and share the treasures of Northern New Mexico with visitors and residents alike. Many people come to Santa Fe for arts, culture, and cuisine, but don't get a chance to appreciate the fascinating natural history. I am excited to bring you on an adventure with me to learn and bask in the beauty of New Mexico. Join me for a few hours, and let's go on an education adventure together!
