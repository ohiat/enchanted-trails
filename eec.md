## Introduction

Santa Fe Nature Guiding LLC (“Santa Fe Nature Guiding”) does not discriminate on the basis of disability. Santa Fe Nature Guiding has developed the following Essential Eligibility Criteria (“EEC”) which are applicable to all participants on Santa Fe Nature Guiding trips.

The purpose of EEC is to help potential Santa Fe Nature Guiding participants identify the skills and abilities necessary to participate on a Santa Fe Nature Guiding trip. The EEC for a specific trip, if not met, will disqualify a person from participating in that trip.  The EEC are applied uniformly to all potential trip participants, irrespective of the presence or absence of any disability. The criteria exist for your own safety and that of all trip participants.

If you identify an EEC that you are unable to meet, please contact Santa Fe Nature Guiding, and we will discuss with you the potential for providing a reasonable modification or accommodation for a specific trip. A reasonable modification or accommodation is one that does not fundamentally alter the nature of the trip or the services that Santa Fe Nature Guiding provides, pose a significant health or safety risk to the participants or trip guides, or that would cause an undue burden or hardship on Santa Fe Nature Guiding, including financial or administrative burdens.

If you plan to use an assistive device, please notify Santa Fe Nature Guiding at the time of registration or as soon as practicable.
